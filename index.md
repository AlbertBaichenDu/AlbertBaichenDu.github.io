## About Me

Hi! I am a final year undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong, majoring in Linguistics. I am interested in sociolinguistics broadly, and speech perception/production, sound change, variation, and their interaction with social effects. 

My UG thesis investigates how attention and awareness of social meaning associated with tone mergers affect asynchronous tonal change in Hong Kong Cantonese. Some other projects I contributed also study phonological learning and bilingualism.

During my undergraduate study, I mainly worked with [Dr. Youngah Do](https://repository.hku.hk/cris/rp/rp02160) and [Dr. Jonathan Havenhill](https://jhavenhill.com) at the [Language Development Lab](https://linguistics.hku.hk/ldlhku/) of the linguistics department at HKU. I also worked with [Dr. Haohan Chen](https://haohanchen.github.io/) on statistical programming and machine learning of text data processing, and [Prof. Melanie Soderstrom](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~soderstr/) on social effects influencing Infant-Directed Speech and early language acquisition.

Apart from academic interests, I also enjoy photographing, cycling, and hiking. One of my life goals is to keep a Ragdoll at home, though I have not achieved it yet :p

See my [CV](https://albertbaichendu.github.io/assets/BAICHEN_DU_CV_2022-06-30.pdf) for more.
